# Blue Switch Bots

Blue Switch Bots is an Android app that aims to extend the usage of [SwitchBots](https://www.switch-bot.com/bot).

This app controls a SwitchBot if the phone that has this app installed receives a SMS with a key configured for that SwitchBot by the app. Naturally to control the SwitchBot the phone must be within the Bluetooth range of the SwitchBot.
