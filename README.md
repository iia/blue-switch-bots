# Blue Switch Bots

Blue Switch Bots is an Android app that aims to extend the usage of [SwitchBots](https://www.switch-bot.com/bot).

This app clicks a SwitchBot if the phone that has this app installed receives a SMS with a secret key configured for that SwitchBot. Naturally to click the SwitchBot the phone must be within the Bluetooth range of the SwitchBot.

:warning: **_For usage, details, and documentation refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/iia/blue-switch-bots/wiki)._**
